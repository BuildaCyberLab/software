## **Computer Software: A Comprehensive Perspective**

### **1. Definition and Core Functions**
Computer software refers to a structured set of instructions or data that enables a computer to perform specific tasks. It transforms hardware into functional tools, driving processes ranging from basic operations to complex computations.

Key functions of software:
- Enable user interaction with hardware (via interfaces).
- Automate repetitive tasks and processes.
- Facilitate communication between systems and applications.
- Ensure performance, scalability, and reliability in diverse environments.
